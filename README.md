# E-commerce Website
- created a E-Commerce website which includes clothing,jeweleries and electronics using React.
    - Created a body for three sections and Linked them to the products page
    - used Link tag to do this and react-router-dom for routing
    - added different features in the product card like Add-to-cart,selecting items..etc
    - created a cart page 
        - for this i used Redux to decrease the state variables
        - created consigureStore from redux for creating a store for different slices in the redux
        - imported Provider from react-redux and gave the store in the provider
        - created a slice using createSlice for cart
        - then addded this slice into the store and used useSelector for subscribing the store so that we can get the data
        - then dispatched the action with useDispatch hook
        - implemented Clear-cart, Delete-cart, selecting items for the final buying the product...etc
